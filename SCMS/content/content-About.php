    <p> The school clinic project management system 
        is designed to streamline administrative and 
        operational functions within school clinics allowing 
        healthcare staff to manage student health records and 
        emergency notifications more efficiently. The system will enable
        school staff to provide better health care support while improving data security and accessibility. 
        The primary deliverables of this project are the development, testing and implementation of a comprehensive 
        software system for school clinics along with accompanying user documentation and training resources.
        This project aligns with the school districts goals to enhance health services
        for students through technology and improve clinic workflow.</p>
